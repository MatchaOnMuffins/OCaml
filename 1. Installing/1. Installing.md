# Installing OCAML


A quick guide to installing OCAML is available [here](https://ocaml.org/install)


## Running the install script

You can run the install script to install `opam`, the OCAML package manager on your system

```
bash -c "sh <(curl -fsSL https://opam.ocaml.org/install.sh)"
```

## Init Opam

`opam` needs to be initialized before you can use it. Run the following command to init it

```
opam init
```

You can accept all the default options for now

## Setup Development Env

To setup an OCaml development environment, you can use the `OCaml platform tools`, which includes `Dune`.

`Dune` is a build system for OCaml projects, which can be used to [build executables, libraries, run tests, and much more](https://dune.build)

To install everything, run the following command:

```
opam install ocaml-lsp-server odoc ocamlformat utop
```
