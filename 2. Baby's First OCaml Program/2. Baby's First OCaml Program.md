# Baby's First OCaml Program

Before we get started, let's try writing a simple hello world program

## OCaml Hello World
Create a new file called `hello_world.ml`

In the file, enter the following

```ocaml
print_endline "Hello, World!";
```

Now, you have two options. You can either use the ocaml interpreter to run the program in a script like fashion (a bit like python), or you can compile the program like C/C++

## Direct interpretation

To run the OCaml interpreter on your Hello World program, we use the `ocaml` command line utility. Run the following in your terminal

```bash
ocaml hello_world.ml
```

your output should look like this

```txt
Hello, World!
```

## Compiling
We can use the `ocamlc` compiler to compile OCaml files to machine code, similarly to C++ or Rust.
Run the following command 

```bash
ocamlc hello_world.ml -o hello_world
```

This will compile the `hello_world.ml` file and output an executable file named `hello_world`.

Run the `hello_world` program, and you should see the following output

```txt
Hello, World!
```


## What's next?

Now you know how to output text from OCaml to the terminal. Can you make it output other types of data, such as numbers? Flowing point numbers? Multiple lines of text? Try modifying your `hello_world.ml` file and see what the output looks like!
